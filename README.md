# GroupProject.WG_Planer
This is the branch of "Zusibell". Everything he develops will take place in this branch and will then be pushed to branche "development when finished. In the branch "development" will always be the newest version of the App. If the App in its current state is ready for testing, the App will then be transfered in branche "testing".

We will NOT work in the branch "master", so that "master" holds just the running, latest version of the App. Later, the "master" branch can, and will only, be merged with the "testing" branch for our group-project of developing an app in university
